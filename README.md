🔥 The Totally-Not-NSA Firewall 🛡️
Ever wanted to feel like a cyber-security genius without actually doing any real work? Well, you're in luck! Introducing the Totally-Not-NSA Firewall – a Python script that randomly decides the fate of innocent IPs. 😈

🕵️‍♂️ What Does It Do?
This script:
✅ Randomly generates IP addresses (yes, even from top-secret subnets)
✅ Decides whether to block, allow, or rate-limit them like a true cyber overlord
✅ Logs everything with timestamps, because every firewall needs a paper trail 📜

⚙️ How It Works
Blocklist: Certain IPs are already doomed. 😵
Allowlist: Some lucky ones get VIP access. 🎟️
Rate Limiting: Spammers and bots? Blocked after 3 tries. 🚫
🚀 How to Run
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/totally-not-nsa-firewall.git
cd totally-not-nsa-firewall
Fire it up like a true hacker:

python3 firewall.py

Watch the IP apocalypse unfold. 🌎🔥
💡 Future Enhancements (Maybe?)
Store logs in a file (because logs are cool 📂)
Let users add/remove rules dynamically
Maybe… a GUI? (nah, that’s too professional)
